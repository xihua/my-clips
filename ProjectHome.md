This project aims to implement an advanced clipboard manager for smart phones using Android OS.

You can easily organize, view and share your clips with `MyClips`.

  * To open `MyClips`, slide notification bar down and tap the `MyClips` GUI service notification or open installed apps and tap `MyClips`.
  * `MyClips` app starts and runs as an background service in your phone. So, even though you don't touch `MyClips` app, it will continuously save anything you copy into its default clipboard.
  * To create a new clipboard, you can use `Menu` button to see options or just shake your phone.
  * Your next clips will go into the last clipboard that you left in `MyClips` GUI.
  * To send a clipboard via email, use `Menu` button.
  * To delete a clipboard, use `Menu` button.
  * To send a clip use long-tap on the clip. A context menu will appear for the clip's `Info`, `Email` and `Delete`.
  * To change the view of clipboards, you can either slide right-left on touch screen or for list view you can use `Menu` button.


Our test phone was `HTC Tattoo` with OS Version `Android 1.6` and with `API Level 4`.
